        <strong>Abstract:</strong> The Infinite Monkey Theorem is a fascinating concept in probability theory that suggests an infinite number of monkeys, given enough time, would eventually type out the complete works of Shakespeare or any other given text. This paper explores the theorem's implications, methodology, and significance in understanding probability and the potential outcomes over an infinite time frame. Through a simulated experiment, we replicate the monkey's random key presses and measure the matching score of generated text with the target text. The results shed light on the probability of reproducing a specific text and highlight the importance of time and randomness in achieving such an outcome.

        <strong>Introduction:</strong> The Infinite Monkey Theorem has captivated the minds of mathematicians and enthusiasts alike for its implications in probability and randomness. In this paper, we delve into the theorem's origins, discuss its theoretical foundations, and present a simulated experiment to examine its practical implications. By simulating the monkeys' random key presses, we aim to understand the probability of reproducing a specific text and explore the potential outcomes over an infinite time frame.
        <br /><br />
        <strong>Methodology:</strong> Our experiment involves generating random text strings through simulated monkey key presses. We measure the matching score of each generated text with the target text to quantify the progress towards a complete reproduction. The experiment runs until the target text is achieved or the simulation is stopped. We record the number of attempts made, the elapsed time, and the highest scoring attempt.
        <br /><br />
        <strong>Results:</strong> The results of our experiment demonstrate the slow but eventual convergence towards the target text. While the probability of reproducing the exact text within a finite amount of time is extremely low, our experiment shows that given enough time, the randomness of the monkeys' key presses can lead to the desired outcome. The matching scores increase gradually with each attempt, providing insights into the progression towards a complete reproduction.
        <br /><br />
        <strong>Discussion:</strong> The experiment highlights the significance of probability and the role of randomness in achieving the Infinite Monkey Theorem's predicted outcome. The slow convergence rate emphasizes the vastness of the search space and the importance of an infinite time frame for reaching the desired result. Our findings contribute to the understanding of probability, demonstrating the potential outcomes over an infinite time horizon.

        <strong>Implications and Significance:</strong> The Infinite Monkey Theorem has implications beyond its theoretical intrigue. It serves as a powerful illustration of the vastness and complexity of probability. The theorem challenges our intuition about randomness and highlights the potential for extraordinary outcomes given infinite possibilities. Furthermore, it underscores the concept of time and its role in achieving specific outcomes, emphasizing the need to consider temporal scales when assessing probabilities.
        <br /><br />
        <strong>Conclusion:</strong> The Infinite Monkey Theorem offers a thought-provoking perspective on probability, randomness, and the potential outcomes over an infinite time frame. Through our experiment, we have demonstrated the gradual convergence towards a target text, showcasing the theorem's theoretical predictions. This paper contributes to the understanding of probability and serves as a reminder of the vastness and possibilities within random systems.
